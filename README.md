# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-
LDA is a probabilistic extension of LSA (also called multinomial PCA), so LDAâ€™s topics can be interpreted as probability distributions over words. These distributions are, just like with LSA, inferred automatically from a training corpus. Documents are in turn interpreted as a (soft) mixture of these topics (again, just like with LSA).
